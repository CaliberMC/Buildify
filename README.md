Buildify mostly adds creative tools for builders but has one survival feature which will be able to be disabled in the 
next update. The Hammer is an item that can be crafted in survival. It allows you to cycle the blockstate of the block 
you are currently targeting by right clicking it. To change which property you are cycling, press left click. In survival 
the Hammer requires Nails to function and requires you to crouch and right click to cycle properties.

Keep this mod bookmarked because it will be in development for a long time to come.
